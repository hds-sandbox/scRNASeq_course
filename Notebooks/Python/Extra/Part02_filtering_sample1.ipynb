    "Quality control and filtering is the most important steps of single cell data analysis. Allowing low quality cells into your analysis will compromise/mislead your conclusions by adding hundreds of meaningless data points to your workflow.\n",
    "The main sources of low quality cells are\n",
    "- broken cells for which some of their transcripts get lost\n",
    "- cells isolated together with too much ambient RNA\n",
    "- missing cell during isolation (e.g. empty droplet in microfluidic machines)\n",
    "- multiple cells isolated together (multiplets, usually only two cells - doublets)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical way of filtering cells is to look at thresholds for various QC measures. Here, we apply also a PCA technique that looks at all QC measures available at the same time.\n",
